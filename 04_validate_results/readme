This 04_validate_results shows example of validate pLDDT, IUPred and LSTM on Xray, SPA and Tomo sequences behind 2022, then automatically analysis.
please keep the folder as same as default, to avoid something error of reading path (but most path can be changed to any desired, anyone could try)

The inputs folder contain prepared input sequences for validation.
For inputs, for every five lines: 
first line, id of protein entry; 
second line, protein sequence; 
third line, pLDDT score sequence; 
forth line, IUPred score sequence; 
fifth line, residue type of true label. Specially, 1 means this residue is "modeled", -2 means "hard missing", -1 means "soft missing".
sixth line, residue type of predicted. Specially, 0 means this residue is "hard missing", 1 means "soft missing", 2 means "modeled".


For inputs folder has three example inputs:
Validation_result_SPA before 2022_output2_balanced_model_300_2500_e2_SPA behind 2022_output2_AAplus
Validation_result_SPA before 2022_output2_balanced_model_300_2500_e2_Tomo behind 2022_output2_AAplus
Validation_result_Xray before 2022_output2_balanced_model_256_1500_e2_Xray behind 2022_output2_AAplus
 
for example, the "Validation_result_SPA before 2022_output2_balanced_model_300_2500_e2_SPA behind 2022_output2_AAplus" means predicted result sequences [trained by "SPA before 2022_output2_balanced", model name "model_300_2500_e2", and validated on file "SPA behind 2022_output2", the "_AAplus" means added with protein sequence into validation result as second line. (adding sequence of input can be done easily)

For valdiation summary, these would be saved to "outputs/" folder. Specially, three kinds of outputs would be output to show analysis results:
"_output1": This output contains all residues of each regions, for example, the residues of [amino acids, plddt, IUPred] for short regions are all included.
"_output2": This output contains all counts of residues compositions, the mean and std of each type of validations and so on.
"_summary": This output contains TP, TN, FP and FN of each results as finial summary.
