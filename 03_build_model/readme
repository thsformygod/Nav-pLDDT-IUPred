This 03 build model shows example of training LSTM on Xray or SPA sequences before 2022, then automatically validated model and output saved model.
please keep the folder as same as default, to avoid something error of reading path (but most path can be changed to any desired, anyone could try)

The inputs folder contain prepared input sequences for training, for every five lines: first line, id of protein entry; second line, protein sequence; third line, pLDDT score sequence; forth line, IUPred score sequence; fifth line, residue type. Specially, 1 means this residue is "modeled", -2 means "hard missing", -1 means "soft missing".

For inputs folder, "Xray" means dataset from Xray dataset, "SPA" means dataset from single particle analysis dataset. "_balanced" means more balanced sequences that filter out sequences which have too less "hard missing" residues (5 residues at least).

For intermediate files, they would be saved to "intermediate/" folder.

For model trained and valdiation summary, these would be saved to "outputs/" folder.
